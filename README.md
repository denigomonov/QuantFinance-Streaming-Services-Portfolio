# QuantFinance-Streaming-Services-Portfolio

## Project Goal:
2020 brought a lot of changes into the world and some things became more popular than ever - streaming services are almost a necessity today. Consumers are not going outside and investors would want to look into streaming stocks. Therefore, in this project I wanted to improve my quantitative finance skills in R and look and the current boom streaming stocks are experiencing, specifically analysing AAPL, NFLX, ROKU, SPOT, DIS. Using Plotly and building visualizations from the scratch, applying Quantmod functions for performance analysis, and implementing ML models for forecasting was a great way to truly learn and showcase financial engineering.
